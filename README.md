# Hi!
 
My name is CTRL+ALT+DOWN, and I develop free, open source Discord bots.

- I’m currently working on a music bot called Moderato 🎵
- You can contact me [via email](mailto:ctrlaltdown@pm.me) 📭
- My pronouns are [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they) or [xe/xem](https://pronoun.is/xe) 🏳️‍🌈
- My name comes from a Windows keyboard shortcut that flips your screen upside down 🙃
